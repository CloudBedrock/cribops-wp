# Place must-use plugins (mu-plugins) here
#
# Must-use plugins are automatically loaded by WordPress
# They do not need to be activated and load before regular plugins
#
# Examples:
# - Single file plugins: place the .php file directly here
# - Plugin directories: place the entire plugin folder here, and create
#   a loader file in this directory that requires the main plugin file
